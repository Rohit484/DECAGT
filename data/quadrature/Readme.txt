This directory consists files of the form d{x}o{y} where x is the degree and y is the order.

The files d1o{y} consists of 1D quadrature nodes and and weights.

The files d2o{y} and d3o{y} provides an interface to Gauss-like quadratures nodes + weights on the unit simplex. These were precomputed using modepy which references: H. Xiao and Z. Gimbutas, "A numerical algorithm for the construction of efficient quadrature rules in two and higher dimensions,"
